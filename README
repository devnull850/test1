This project demos a progression of ideas on the subject of self modifying code.

0 -> Take a raw binary assembled with GAS and scan the ELF format to get the .text section and inject the executable into the code space for the function foo

1 -> Take raw binary bytes from a binary file and inject the data into the foo function

2 -> Host the binary file from 1 on a server and transport the raw data over HTTP connection to inject into the foo function
